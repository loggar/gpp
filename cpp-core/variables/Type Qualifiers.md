# Type Qualifiers in C++

- **const**: Objects of type const cannot be changed by your program during execution.
- **volatile**: The modifier volatile tells the compiler that a variable's value may be changed in ways not explicitly specified by the program.
- **restrict**: A pointer qualified by restrict is initially the only means by which the object it points to can be accessed. Only C99 adds a new type qualifier called restrict.
