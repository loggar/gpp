| 1     | double cos(double);           | This function takes an angle (as a double) and returns the cosine.                                                      |
| 2     | double sin(double);           | This function takes an angle (as a double) and returns the sine.                                                        |
| 3     | double tan(double);           | This function takes an angle (as a double) and returns the tangent.                                                     |
| 4     | double log(double);           | This function takes a number and returns the natural log of that number.                                                |
| 5     | double pow(double, double);   | The first is a number you wish to raise and the second is the power you wish to raise it t                              |
| 6     | double hypot(double, double); | If you pass this function the length of two sides of a right triangle, it will return you the length of the hypotenuse. |
| 7     | double sqrt(double);          | You pass this function a number and it gives you the square root.                                                       |
| 8     | int abs(int);                 | This function returns the absolute value of an integer that is passed to it.                                            |
| 9     | double fabs(double);          | This function returns the absolute value of any decimal number passed to it.                                            |
| 10    | double floor(double);         | Finds the integer which is less than or equal to the argument passed to it.                                             |
